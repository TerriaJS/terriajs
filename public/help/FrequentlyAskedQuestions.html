        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        
        <h2 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >FAQs about National Map Operation</h2>
        <div>
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >Where is the National Map User Manual?</h3>
          <div style="display: none;" >
            <p class="faq" >There isn't one! All
            user interface features of the National Map are either obvious from the interface or are described in this Help.</p>
            <p class="faq" >The National Map has been carefully designed to be as easy to use as possible. Our user experience
            design team run regular usability testing sessions, the results of which are then assessed for inclusion in releases.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >What browsers work with National Map?</h3>
        
            <p class="faq" style="display: none;" >
              It is best to use a browser with WebGL support such as the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer 11.
              It will also work in some older browsers (for example IE9 and IE10) but the map rendering will be limited.
              It may not support 3D rendering of maps, so the <b>3D Terrain</b> option may show the same result as <b>3D Smooth</b>.
            </p>
        
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >What types are spatial data are displayed by National Map?</h3>
          <div style="display: none;" >
            <p class="faq" >There are three types of spatial data which are read from the data sources and displayed by the National Map over its base maps:</p>
            <table style="margin-left: 40px; cell-padding: 15px;" ><tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Point</strong></td><td>Click on any point to see more information about that particular point feature.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Line</strong></td><td>Click on any line to see more information about that particular line feature.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Region</strong></td><td>Click within any region to see more information about that region.</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody></table>
          </div>
                
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >Why do "3D Terrain" and "3D Smooth" Perspective Views look the same on my computer?</h3>
          <div style="display: none;" >
            <p class="faq" >Some older computers do not have graphics cards which fully support WebGL and some older browsers do not make use of
            this support even if it is present. National Map requires this support in order to support 3D Terrain Perspective View.</p>
            
            <p class="faq" >Try upgrading your browser to the latest version. If that still does not work, you may need to consider working
            on a computer that has more recent graphics support.</p>
          </div>
                
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >Why does the terrain in my perspective view have two different hues?</h3>
          <div style="display: none;" >
            <p class="faq" >National Map automatically changes the content of the map according to the scale at which you're viewing.
            If you zoom in it shows more detail. At some points in the zoom range, the map display switches from high altitude photography
            to lower altitude photography. These sets of the photography are not colour matched to each other, so may have quite different hues.
            The actual photography scales used, the date of that photography and its lighting conditions will vary across Australia.</p>
            
            <p class="faq" >When you are using Perspective View the part of the terrain nearest to the "camera position" is naturally shown at
            a larger scale than the more more distant parts. Depending on your zoom level, this can result in the foreground being displayed with
            a different set of photography from the distant parts of your Perspective View.</p>
          </div>
  
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >Why won't National Map work on my mobile phone? It works on my friend's phone.</h3>
        
            <p class="faq" style="display: none;" >
              The current version of National Map is not designed for small screen or touch screen devices.
              However, some devices may operate satisfactorily, especially if they support a mouse connection and WebGL graphics.

        <h2 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >FAQs about the National Map system and data</h2>
        <div>
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >Where does the spatial data come from?</h3>
          <div style="display: none;" >
            <p class="faq" >
              The spatial data displayed by the National Map are all directly referenced from <a href="http://data.gov.au" >data.gov.au</a> or from a
              server provided by the relevant department or agency.
              The National Map does not store any of the data it serves. For example, if you access
              data relating to broadband availability and quality, you are accessing that data directly from the Department of
              Communications. When you access data relating to surface geology, it is accessed directly from Geoscience Australia.
              If you access data relating to water, it is typically coming directly from the Bureau of Meteorology.
              The National Map itself does not store any data - it provides a map-based view of data that is stored by a growing
              number of government bodies.
            </p>
            
            <p class="faq" >
              You can see details of the department or agency that provides the spatial data by clicking on the <strong>Info</strong> link
              for the data set on the <strong>Now Viewing</strong> tab.
            </p> 
          </div>
          
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >The data I was using are now gone. Where did they go?</h3>
          <div style="display: none;" >
            <p class="faq" >
              The spatial data displayed by National Map are referenced directly from the supplying department or agency by the National Map server. 
              If that supplying department or agency updates or removes any data, that change will be reflected immediately by the National Map.
            </p>
        
            <p class="faq" >If you have any questions about the spatial data, you will need to contact the supplying department or agency.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >Where do the base maps come from?</h3>
            
            <p class="faq" style="display: none;" >
              The base maps displayed by the National Map come from a number of difference sources including Microsoft's Bing, Geoscience Australia and NASA. They are downloaded from the source
              as they are required, so they are as up to date as that service provides.
            </p>
          
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >Who developed National Map?</h3>
          
            <p class="faq" style="display: none;" >The National Map was developed by NICTA funded by the Commonwealth Department of Communications and working closely with Geoscience Australia. See the <a href="About.html">About</a> page from more information.</p>
          
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >Who owns the spatial data on National Map? Can I use it and distribute it?</h3>
          <div style="display: none;" >
            <p class="faq" >
              Before distributing any data from National Map it is important to understand the licence restriction for the data.
              All Data Sets displayed by the National Map are the property of the department or agency which has provided them. Therefore the
              restrictions for each Data Set may be quite different. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="faq" >
              The licence which governs the usage and distribution restrictions for each Data Set is shown in the <strong>Info</strong> metadata
              for the Data Set. Display the Data Set in National Map and then select the <strong>Now Viewing</strong> tab. Click on the Data Set's
              <strong>Info</strong> button to see the licence for the Data set.  
            </p>
            
          </div>          
          
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >How reliable is the spatial data on the National Map?</h3>
          
            <p class="faq" style="display: none;" >
              The reliability will vary between data sets. To understand the reliability of a particular data set,
              click on the <strong>Info</strong> link for the data set in question on the <strong>Now Showing</strong> tab for the data. The metadata
              which is shown in this display may offer sufficient information or you may need to contact the data
              provider which is listed in that metadata.
            </p>
          
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >There is some spatial data in New Zealand. Where did it come from?</h3>
          
            <p class="faq" style="display: none;" >
              There is a small number of data sets which have a small amount of data relating to New Zealand.
              This results because the supplying agency is a cooperative agency with New Zealand.
            </p>
          
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >Why can I see the whole world on National Map?</h3>
          <div style="display: none;" >
            <p class="faq" >
              Most of the National Map base maps are provided by services for the whole world. There is no value in
              suppressing the display of the rest of the world, so you can view it if you wish.
              (Take a look at Mt Everest or the Grand Canyon in perspective view - they're cool!)
            </p>
            <p class="faq" >Obviously, the National Map's spatial data does not cover the rest of the world!</p>
          </div>
          
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >Will more Data Sets be added to National Map?</h3>
          <div style="display: none;" >
            <p class="faq" >
              That depends on the supplying departments or agencies, who must make the data available. You will need to
              contact individual data providers to understand their data release schedules.
            </p>
            <p class="faq" >
              If you are a data provider, see the <a href="HowTo.html">How To</a> page for information on adding Data Sets to the National Map.

            <p class="faq" style="display: none;" >Email us on <a href="mailto:nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au" >nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au</a>
            to report the problem. Be sure to include a step by step description of how to reproduce the problem.</p>
          
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >I'd love a new feature. Can I suggest it?</h3>
          
            <p class="faq" style="display: none;" >Absolutely. Just email your suggestion to
            <a href="mailto:nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au" >nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au</a>.
            Please do not expect an immediate response. There are many conflicting priorities for the development of National Map, so it will not
            be possible to react to all requests promptly.</p>
          
          <h3 style="cursor: default;" onclick="toggleShowNext(this)" >I think there's an error in some data. How can I find out

          <div style="display: none;" >        
            <p class="faq" >The data displayed by the National Map are only referred to by the National Map and are not part of the
            National Map. You will need to refer to the department or agency which provides the Data Set which contains the issue.</p>
