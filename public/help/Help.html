        <p>There are mutliple ways to navigate National Map's map view. Use whichever method you prefer.

              <p><b>Right-click</b> and <b>drag</b> upwards or downwards over the map to zoom about the centre point. (Dragging left or right has no effect.)

              but it also results in the total loss of all your context information from the current session, which includes display information
              and selected Data Sets. It is not recommended unless you are experiencing problems.)</i></p>

              in the centre
              of the <strong>Compass Control</strong> and drag slowly to the left or right to rotate the map clockwise or anti-clockwise respectively.
              The further you drag, the faster it rotates. Release the mouse button when you reach the desired rotation.</p>
                         
              <p>Click on the North Point or outer ring of the <b>Compass Conrol</b> (see image below)
              and drag it around to set the desired rotation directly.</p>
              
              <p><b>Control + left-click</b> and <b>drag</b> left or right over the map to rotate the view about the centre. (On Windows
              systems you can also use <b>Middle-click</b> and <b>drag</b>.)</p>

              <p>Click on the "gyroscope" in the centre of the <strong>Compass Control</strong> (see image below) and drag slowly upwards
              to tilt the view into a Perspective View. Drag downwards
              to tilt the view back to vertical. The further you drag, the faster it tilts. Release the mouse button when you reach the
              desired view.</p>
              
              <p><b>Control + left-click</b> and <b>drag</b> upwards or downwards over the map
              to enter or adjust the perspective view. (On Windows
              systems you can also use <b>Middle-click</b> and <b>drag</b>.)</p>
              
              <p>When you are in Perspective View, <b>Control + left-click</b> and <b>drag</b> left or right over the map
              to "orbit" around the centre of the view. You can also click and drag left or right over the "gyroscope" at the centre
              of the <b>Compass Control</b> to orbit about the centre of the view.</p>
              
              <p><b>Double-click</b> the "gyroscope" in the centre of the <b>Compass Control</b> to return the view quickly to a vertical view with
              North to the top at the current location and scale.</p>
                                    
              <p>Dragging to Pan and using the Mouse Wheel to zoom still work while showing a Perspective View.</p>
              
              <p>Even the topography and road maps can be viewed in perspective.</p>
              
              <p>You can't simulate looking from under the ground because the system always keeps the "camera position" above the earth's surface,
              but you can create a view which is looking only at the sky. Tilt back downwards to recover.</p>
              
              <p><i>Hint: In Australia, Cradle Mountain and Katoomba are good places to use for experimenting with Perspective View.
              Use the <a href="SearchTab.html">Search Tab</a>
              to locate them. (Other very high relief areas like the Grand Canyon or Mount Everest - not the ones in NSW - are also really cool!)</i></p>
