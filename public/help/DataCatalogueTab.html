        <h1>Data Catalogue Tab</h1>
        
        <p>Click <strong>Data Catalogue</strong> to see the Data Sets you can display on the map view. They are organised into groups and sub-groups
        to make them easier to locate.</p>
        
        <img src="img/DataCatalogueTab.png" width=50% ><img src="img/SelectDataSet.png" width=50% >
          
        <ul>
        
          <li><p>Click a Data Set <b>Group Name</b> (for example, <strong>National Data Sets</strong>) to see the Data Sets in that group.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li><p>Click a Data Set <b>Sub-group Name</b> (for example <strong>Communications</strong>) to see the
               Data Sets in that sub-group.</p>
          </li>
               
          <li><p>Click the <b>check box</b> to the left of the Data Set name to display that Data Set on the map. You can select as
               many as you like from any Group or Sub-group you like, but selecting too many will make for a very cluttered and confused display, and
               may make navigating in the Map View sluggish.</p>
          </li>
               
          <li><p>Click on the <b>Data Set Name</b> of any Data Set which you have already selected for display to cause the Map View to zoom to a view which just
               encloses all of the data in that Data Set. Data Sets which consist of a couple of small features on either side of the country may
               still be difficult to identify on the map. In this case you will need to zoom in manually to the correct location.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li><p>Click on the <img src="img/InfoButton.png" > button if any Data Set (even if it is not currently displayed) to show the available metadata
          for that Data Set. The metadata includes the licence, which says what you can and can't do with the data.</p>
          </li>
          
        </ul>
        
        <p>To search for a particular Data Set, see the <a href=SearchTab.html" >Search Tab</a>.</p>
        
        <p>The display of your Data Sets can be tuned using the <a href="NowViewingTab.html">Now Viewing Tab</a> tab, which shows a legend
        of your selected Data Sets.</p>
