Once you're up and running, see [Working with Terria](/Documentation/WorkingWithTerria) for tweaking, configuring and skinning information.

In addition to deploying Terria itself, you may want to install support services:

* [Setting up a region mapping server](Setting-up-a-region-mapping-server.md): to add additional region mapping types, or to avoid depending on Data61 infrastructure.
* [Using a vector tile source](Using-a-vector-tile-source-for-region-mapping.md): setting up a vector tile source for region mapping. This is an experimental feature that is still in development.
* [WMS Services](WMS-Services.md): how to set up your own GeoServer to provide WMS services.
