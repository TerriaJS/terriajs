Most of our production TerriaJS-based sites are hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This page describes how to use the automated AWS deployment mechanism available in TerriaMap. There are, of course, countless other ways to deploy to AWS.

## Prerequisites

### awscli

Deploying requires a recent version of `awscli`. It's recommended to install and maintain this using `pip` as the Homebrew and Ubuntu packages are quite old.

```sh
pip install awscli
```

### AWS credentials

You must have an `awscli` configuration profile (in `~/.aws/config`) with a name that matches `awsProfile` in `package.json`. e.g.

```
[profile terria]
aws_access_key_id=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key=YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

## package.json

Various parameters controlling AWS deployment are specified in `package.json`. They are:

- `awsProfile` - The AWS profile to use (see AWS credentials above) when interacting with AWS.
- `awsS3PackagesPath` - The S3 path to which to copy the deployment .tar.gz.
- `awsRegion` - The AWS region in which to create resources.
- `awsEc2InstanceType` - The type of EC2 instance to use.
- `awsEc2ImageId` - The ID of the EC2 image to use.
- `awsKeyName` - The name of a key that may be used to SSH to the EC2 instance.
- `awsS3ServerConfigOverridePath` - The path to a file on S3 containing any overrides to `devserverconfig.json`.
- `awsS3ClientConfigOverridePath` - The path to a file on S3 containing any overrides to `wwwroot/config.json`.

You can customize these settings by changing `package.json`, or by using `npm config` to override the setting locally, for example;

```
npm config set terriajs-map:awsProfile myprofilename
```

## stack.json

You will need to modify [deploy/aws/stack.json](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap/blob/master/deploy/aws/stack.json) to match your environment. In particular, you will need to change:

- `Parameters.HostedZoneName.Default`: This is the domain name where a DNS record for the deployment will be created.
- `SSLCertificateId` in `Resources.ElasticLoadBalancer.Listeners`: The SSL certificate to use for HTTPS connections to the deployment. If you don't have a certificate or don't want to support HTTPS, remove the entire listener with `"LoadBalancerPort": "443"`.
- `terriamap-sharing` in `Resources.S3Role.Properties.Policies.PolicyDocument.Statement`: This authorizes the EC2 instances to access an S3 bucket to be used to store JSON blobs for the sharing feature. You will want to create a bucket for this purpose and add its name here.

## Deploy

Prior to deploying, please tag the release, e.g.

```
git tag -a 2016-05-17 -m '2016-05-17 release'
git push origin 2016-05-17
```

Deployment is initiated via `npm` scripts. A full production deployment may be initiated with:

```
yarn deploy
```

Once the stack starts up, it will be available at `terriajs-map-2016-05-17.terria.io`, where `terriajs-map` is the name of the project in `package.json` and `2016-05-17` is the output of `git describe` (that's why you should tag before starting a deployment).

The following npm scripts are available:

- `deploy` - Removes the `node_modules` directory, runs `npm install`, and launches the `deploy-without-reinstall` script.
- `deploy-without-reinstall` - Runs `gulp clean` (which removes the `wwwroot/build` directory) and `gulp release`, and then launches the `deploy-current` script.
- `deploy-current` - Gets the two configuration override files specified in package.json from S3, builds a package (.tar.gz), uploads it to S3, and spins up a CloudFormation stack.

The CloudFormation stack has the following AWS resources:

- Elastic Load Balancer
- EC2 Security Group
- Auto Scaling Group
- Launch Configurartion
- Route 53 Record Set

Instances in the Auto Scaling group are bootstrapped using the supplied `user-data` file.

The process of starting a new stack takes about 5 minutes but it can take a further 15 minutes for the DNS to propagate.

### Test stack

Each stack is automatically assigned its own URL based on the name of the stack. e.g.

```
https://terriajs-map-2016-05-17.terria.io/
```

### Update DNS alias

Once you're satisfied the release is working, change the staging environment DNS record to point to the new stack using the Route 53 Console.

```
map.terria.io -> terriajs-map-2016-05-17.terria.io
```

### Troubleshooting

The default Mac OS `tar` command [causes trouble](http://superuser.com/questions/318809/linux-os-x-tar-incompatibility-tarballs-created-on-os-x-give-errors-when-unt). You'll need to replace it with `gtar`, eg. using homebrew.
